FIGHT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATION ("MUSLIM BAN")
=======================================================

What's happening? 
-----------------
Donald Trump issued an executive order banning all travel for 120 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries. 
The ban includes a suspension of refugee resettlement in the U.S. for these 120 days, and for those from 
Syria, indefinitely. There is no evidence in support of the posited terror risks due to nationals from these 
countries, and especially from refugees (not a single American has ever been killed in the U.S. by nationals of these countries)

Who can do what?
----------------
Congress can override an executive order (and presidential veto of such an over-ride) with a 2/3rd majority. 
Other measures can be taken with a simple majority, such as to refuse to fund provisions that make 
implementation of the order possible. 

What can you do?
----------------
[Call](#call) and [write](#write) your Representatives, particularly Republicans (as Democrats are already united
against the ban), highlighting the many arguments that counter this order. 


Call
====
> My name is ____ and I'm a constituent in the 23rd District of New York (zip code XXXXX). I'm calling to let Congressman Reed know that I am in strong opposition to the recent ban on immigration issued by President Trump's Executive Order last Friday. This ban runs counter to all evidence, given that no refugees from any of the targeted countries have ever killed Americans on U.S. soil. It is also a moral outrage, and violates not only our constitution but our values as a nation of immigrants. I urge the congressman to stand up against President Trump and his Republican colleagues and insist that this ban be repealed.

> Arguments against this order stand on firm rational and ethical footing. The President says that this is a temporary measure, until we learn “what’s going on.” However, there are a few things we already know about “what’s going on,” including that:
> The number of Americans killed in the U.S. since 1975 by nationals of the countries singled out in this order is exactly ZERO;
>  The number of Americans killed by Syrian refugees ever is likewise exactly ZERO;
> The number of refugees of any origin that have killed Americans in the U.S. in the past 40 years is THREE (all of Cuban origin, in the 1970s), out of 3.5 million admitted;[1]
> At the same time, Jihadist and ISIS leaders could hardly be more pleased, declaring on Twitter that this ban supports their propaganda regarding the U.S. “ war on Islam” and is the greatest gift for recruitment since the Iraq War.[2] More than 100 national security experts from both parties have concurred that this ban “will do long-term damage to our national security.”[3]
>
> These facts should be sufficient; and yet, they are still less compelling than the fundamental moral outrage that every American should feel in the face of this assault against our common values as a nation of immigrants. Discrimination based on religious affiliation—which we know that this ban represents, in spite of some claims to the contrary[4]—is in direct violation of the 1st and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. As if that is not enough, the UN estimates that 20,000 refugees are currently directly affected by the 120-day ban, most of them women and children who have gone through extensive vetting and are awaiting resettlement in untenable circumstances.[5] Thousands of innocent people will likely die as a direct result of this stroke of a pen.
>
> A full repeal of this Executive Order is the only outcome that is acceptable—with utmost urgency and attention on the provisions that affect refugees of all origins.
>
> I look forward to your response to the points made here, and assure you that you will be hearing from me and my many like-minded friends and colleagues until this issue is settled.
