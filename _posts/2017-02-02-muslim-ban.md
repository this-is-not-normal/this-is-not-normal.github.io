Fight the Executive Order on Immigration ("Muslim Ban")
=======================================================

What's happening? 
-----------------
Donald Trump issued an executive order banning all travel for 120 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries. 
The ban includes a suspension of refugee resettlement in the U.S. for these 120 days, and for those from 
Syria, indefinitely. There is no evidence in support of the posited terror risks due to nationals from these 
countries, and especially from refugees (not a single American has ever been killed in the U.S. by nationals of these countries)

Who can do what?
----------------
Congress can override an executive order (and presidential veto of such an over-ride) with a 2/3rd majority. 
Other measures can be taken with a simple majority, such as to refuse to fund provisions that make 
implementation of the order possible. 

What can you do?
----------------
[Call](#call) and [write](/letter/2017-02-02-muslim-ban.doc) your Representatives, particularly Republicans (as Democrats are already united
against the ban), highlighting the many arguments that counter this order. 


Call
====
> My name is ---- and I'm a constituent in the --- District of ---- (zip code -----). I'm calling to let Congressman Reed know that I am in strong opposition to the recent ban on immigration issued by President Trump's Executive Order last Friday. This ban runs counter to all evidence, given that no refugees from any of the targeted countries have ever killed Americans on U.S. soil. It is also a moral outrage, and violates not only our constitution but our values as a nation of immigrants. I urge the congressman to stand up against President Trump and his Republican colleagues and insist that this ban be repealed.
